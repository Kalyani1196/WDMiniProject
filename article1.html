  <h1>The Rise of Street Art</h1>
  <p>Street art has transitioned from being an illegal act of rebellion to a respected form of public expression. From spray-painted murals to thought-provoking stencils, this form of art now decorates cities all over the world.</p>
  <p>Many artists use walls and streets as their canvas to communicate messages about social justice, identity, and culture. Cities like Berlin, New York, and São Paulo have embraced street art, turning neighborhoods into open-air galleries.</p>
  <p>As public interest grows, local governments and organizations have begun to support street artists with dedicated spaces and festivals.</p>
